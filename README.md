# KenKen
The project was built entirely in Java on the model of the classic KenKen. KenKen is a game similar to Sudoku, a square table of different dimensions is used, in this case 3x3 or 6x6 but in general the dimensions can be nxn. Each row and each column of the table must have all the numbers from 1 to n and must not contain repetitions. In Sudoku the table is divided into groups of fixed size, equal to n (also within them the numbers from 1 to n must be contained without repetitions), while in the case of KenKen the groups are of random size, each group has a number and an operation, for example 6x and the numbers contained in that group must give that result by performing that operation between them. KenKen groups can also be of a single element, in which case their result is equal to the element within them and no operation is represented. In addition, the groups that contain subtractions or divisions have a fixed size of 2. The solution of a KenKen is obtained when the table can be filled respecting all the constraints of columns, rows and groups.
